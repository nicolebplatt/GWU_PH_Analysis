## Summary
In order to plan accordingly for the upcoming "silver tsunami," the below information provides additional insight and answers for the future at PH:

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
	- Assuming that once the "silver tsunami" begins PH plans to fill each role by either training and promoting internal employees or seeking external applicants, then PH will need to fill 72,458 jobs that are currently held by unique eligible retirees.

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
	-Simply put, no, there will not be enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. If the new mentorship program only utilizes employees born in 1965, then only 1,549 employees would be eligible to participate as mentors. The breakdown of these potential mentors by title can be viewed below:

However, if the program were expanded to also includes an option that encourages experienced employees eligible to retire (and there are over 72,000 of them) to instead take on a part-time role of mentorship rather than retiring completely, then it might be possible to mitigate some of the effects of the "silver tsunami."
